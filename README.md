# rprogramming

## R001
This is my first R project; I used an open-source dataset about mental health from Kaggle which you can find here: 

[ www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset ]

This is also a homework for my class [ DAT 301: Exploring Data in R and Python ] at Arizona State University.

### Main Takeaway
- Familiarize myself with the basics of R programming, including RStudio, packages, data types, plotting
- First time making ioslides and publishing to RPub
- First time using open-source datasets from Kaggle
