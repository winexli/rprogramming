## R001
This is my first R project; I used an open-source dataset about mental health from Kaggle which you can find here: 

[ www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset ]

This is also a homework for my class [ DAT 301: Exploring Data in R and Python ] at Arizona State University.

### Main Takeaway
- Familiarize myself with the basics of R programming, including RStudio, packages, data types, plotting
- First time making ioslides and publishing to RPub
- First time using open-source datasets from Kaggle

## R002
In my second R project, I used an open-source dataset about heart disease from Kaggle which you can find here:

[ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset/data ]

Given the background of increasing risk of heart disease, my focus is on the prediction and prevention of this condition. 
I will employ exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, and feature importance techniques to identify key risk factors and address this critical issue.

This is also a project for my class [ DAT 301: Exploring Data in R and Python ] at Arizona State University.

### Main Takeaway
- First time defining a problem and seeking statistically based decisions.
- Implemented process improvements that significantly increased working efficiency
- Demonstrated strong attention to detail when collecting, analyzing, and working with data
