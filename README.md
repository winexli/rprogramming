# R Programming

## R003 (06/15/2024)
In this project focused on building shiny app with R, I used an open-source dataset about mental health from Kaggle which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/tesla-stock-data-updated-till-28jun2021)

This is also a homework for my class [ DAT 301: Exploring Data in R and Python ] at Arizona State University.

### Quick Overview
You can find the presentation on [shinyapps.io](https://winex.shinyapps.io/lab3/)

### Main Takeaway
- Familiarize myself with the basics of Shiny App in R
- First time publishing to shinyapps.io


## R002 (06/14/2024)
In my second R project, I used an open-source dataset about heart disease from Kaggle which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset/data)

Given the background of increasing risk of heart disease, my focus is on the prediction and prevention of this condition. 
I will employ exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, and feature importance techniques to identify key risk factors and address this critical issue.

This is also a project for my class [ DAT 301: Exploring Data in R and Python ] at Arizona State University.
### Quick Overview

### Main Takeaway
- First time defining a problem and seeking statistically based decisions.
- Implemented process improvements that significantly increased working efficiency
- Demonstrated strong attention to detail when collecting, analyzing, and working with data


## R001 (06/12/2024)
This is my __first__ R project; I used an open-source dataset about mental health from Kaggle which you can find [here](www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset)

This is also a homework for my class [ DAT 301: Exploring Data in R and Python ] at Arizona State University.

### Quick Overview
You can find the presentation on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Cook1e/mentalHealthAnalysis)

### Main Takeaway
- Familiarize myself with the basics of R programming, including RStudio, packages, data types, plotting
- First time making ioslides and publishing to RPub
- First time using open-source datasets from Kaggle
